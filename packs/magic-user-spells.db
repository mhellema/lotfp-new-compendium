This increase changes a creature&rsquo;s size by 20% per caster level, up to three times the original size of the creature. The effectiveness of this spell is half of this on non-living objects, which are only enlarged 10% per level and to a maximum of double the original size of the object. The caster can affect a 10' cube of living matter per level or a 5' cube per level of non-living matter. Magical item properties are not affected by this spell. For instance, a wand will have the same function even though it is increased to the size of a staff, and potion dosages are not increased, though they may take longer to drink. Objects do become stronger or heavier, so that a small rock gains the weight of an appropriately sized larger one, and a person enlarged will have a strength appropriate to his size (as an ogre or a giant, for example) with corresponding strength adjustments. The damage done by an Enlarged character during m&ecirc;l&eacute;e is increased by the same percentage as his size.
